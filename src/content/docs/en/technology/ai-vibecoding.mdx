# AI Agent Architecture (VTI)

The heart of Aether Lens is its unique **Vibe Test Insight (VTI)** analysis engine. It goes beyond simple static analysis or diff detection to multi-dimensionally understand the developer's "intent."

## Aether Platform Context

VTI analysis leverages the vast context of the Aether Platform.

- **Platform Intelligence**: Automatically injects cloud infrastructure, deployment status, resource statistics, etc., into the analysis context.
- **Shared Insights**: Insights gained from individual DevLoops are shared across the platform to improve team productivity.

## 3-Layer Analysis Logic

1. **Context Reaper**:
   Constantly monitors not only project configuration but also environment settings on the Aether Platform.
2. **Intent Scouter**:
   Multi-dimensionally grasps "developer vibes" and "impact on the system" from Git diffs.
3. **Action Weaver**:
   Configures the optimal execution actions in cloud environments (Browserless, etc.) based on reasoning.

## Optional Analysis Controls

While it operates in full-auto by default, developers can fine-tune the analysis using the following "knobs."

- **Frontend Strategy**: Forces UI regression checks.
- **Backend Strategy**: Prioritizes logic analysis.
- **Custom Instructions**: Injects unique rules via `aether-lens.config.json`.

## Integration with Aether Platform

Executed on the secure infrastructure of the Aether Platform, making large-scale project analysis both fast and safe. Analysis results are shared with external AI agents via the MCP (Model Context Protocol).
