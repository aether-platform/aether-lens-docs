## Vibe Test Insights (VTI)

Aether Lens is more than just a test automation tool. It's the intelligence that understands the developer's "vibes" and radically accelerates the cycle.

## Accelerate Your Development

"Code changes shouldn't just run tests; they should reveal insights."

What determines the speed of development is the time spent "waiting for confirmation." Aether Lens minimizes them, allowing you to stay in your most creative moments.

### ⚡️ Next-Gen Feedback Loop (Lens Loop)

The essence of Aether Lens lies in its **tight integration with AI Agents via MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. Verification repeats autonomously in the background without the developer needing to be aware of it.

1. **NPU Accelerated Edge AI**: Leverage local NPUs to the fullest. By performing primary analysis and summarization (distillation) on the NPU before sending raw logs or data to the cloud, token consumption is reduced by up to 90%, balancing privacy and speed.
2. **Shadow Verification**: While you code, Lens continuously checks the UI and logic in the background, providing instant summaries via MCP to your AI agents.
3. **Layered Context Synergy**: No need to include all logs in every prompt. Layered context provisioning saves tokens to the extreme while delivering reliable corrective insights.
4. **Unified QA Platform**: QA teams can leverage the exact same environment as developers. By unifying development and test automation on one platform, delivery speed is dramatically increased.
