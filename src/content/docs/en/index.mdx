## Innovation by Vibe Test Insight (VTI)

Aether Lens is more than just a test automation tool. It is the intelligence that understands the developer's "vibe" and shortens the cycle to the limit.

## Accelerate Your Development

"Code changes shouldn't just run tests; they should reveal insights."

What determines the speed of development is the time spent "waiting for confirmation." Aether Lens minimizes them, allowing you to stay in your most creative moments.

### ⚡️ Next-Generation Feedback Loop

1. **Focus on Quality**: AI monitors regressions, allowing you to push with confidence.
2. **Context-Aware**: Learns the rules and "vibe" unique to your project and provides appropriate advice.
3. **Zero Configuration**: `aether-lens init` and `aether-lens --watch`. That's all it takes for your project to gain intelligence.
