# Deployment Integration

Aether Lens supports various deployment methods for local development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
You can configure these interactively using the `init` command or by editing the configuration file directly.

## Docker Compose

For projects using Docker Compose, Aether Lens can be configured to automatically restart or update containers upon change detection.

### Configuration

Select `docker-compose` as the execution strategy when running `aether-lens-cli init`, or add the following to your `aether-lens.config.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "type": "docker-compose",
    "file": "docker-compose.yaml",
    "service": "app" // (Optional) Specify if you only want to update a specific service
  }
}
```

### Behavior
- When file changes are detected, the service state is updated based on the specified `docker-compose.yaml`.
- In `watch` mode, tests are automatically executed after the container restart.

## Kustomize

If you are using Kustomize for Kubernetes deployment, you can integrate the flow of applying overlays and generating manifests.

### Configuration

Select `kustomize` as the execution strategy when running `aether-lens-cli init`, or add the following to the configuration file:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "type": "kustomize",
    "path": "overlays/dev" // Path where Kustomization.yaml is located
  }
}
```

### Behavior
- `kubectl apply -k <path>` is executed upon change detection.
- Even when used with other tools like Tilt, Aether Lens functions as a trigger for test execution.

## Caveats

- **Path Resolution**: Paths in the configuration file are resolved relative to the root directory where `aether-lens-cli` is executed.
- **Permissions**: Execution permissions for `kubectl` or `docker` commands are required.
