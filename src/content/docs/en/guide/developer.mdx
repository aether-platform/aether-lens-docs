# For Developers

Aether Lens is under active development, and the latest features are immediately available as **Nightly Builds** on GitHub.
You can also install specific commits or tags depending on your project requirements.

## Installing from GitHub

You can execute or install the tool directly from the GitHub repository using `uv` or `uvx`.

### Using Nightly Build (Latest)

To use the latest state of the `main` branch:

```bash
# Run from the latest main branch
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens aether-lens-cli --version

# Permanently install the latest main branch
uv pip install git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens
```

### Version Pinning

When you want to strictly lock the tool version for team development, specify a Git tag or commit hash.

#### By Tag (Recommended)

```bash
# Specify the Nightly tag
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens@nightly aether-lens-cli --version

# Specify v0.1.0 tag
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens@v0.1.0 aether-lens-cli --version
```

#### By Commit Hash

Useful when you need to rollback to a specific change.

```bash
# Specify a commit hash (SHA)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens@a1b2c3d aether-lens-cli --version
```

## Applying to MCP Configuration

If you want your AI Agents (Claude / AntiGravity) to use a specific version, configure the `args` in your settings file as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aether-lens": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/aether-platform/aether-lens@nightly",
        "aether-lens-cli",
        "mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By configuring it this way, the entire team can share Aether Lens as a "living specification" that always behaves consistently.
