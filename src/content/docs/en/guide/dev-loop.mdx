# Local DevLoop Acceleration

In modern development, the biggest bottleneck is the "lag between rewriting and verification." Aether Lens utilizes AI analysis and a fast feedback loop to shorten this cycle to the extreme.

## Execution Infrastructure on Aether Platform Native

As part of the Aether Platform, Aether Lens natively leverages a powerful cloud execution environment.

- **LensDaemon**: A service that manages the monitoring and execution lifecycle. It synchronizes with the platform to optimize resources.
- **Browserless Orchestrator**: Works with the sidecar environment on the platform to execute heavy rendering processes and multi-device verification in parallel on the cloud.
- **Smart Debouncing**: Provides smooth feedback to developers even with fast edits, while reducing the load on the platform side.

## Automated Pipeline

1. **Code Edit**: Developer saves a file.
2. **AI Vibe Check**: AI determines the "intent" and "risk" of changes in seconds.
3. **Execution**: Automatically runs a minimum set of tests (Visual / Command).
4. **Insight Feed**: Aggregates analysis results and execution status into the CLI summary panel.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Using `uv` allows for fast and clean dependency resolution.

```bash
uv pip install -e . --system
```

### 2. Initial Setup

Select a strategy that suits your project interactively.

```bash
aether-lens-cli init
```

### 3. Start LIVE Monitoring

As soon as you start `watch` mode, the Local DevLoop begins.

```bash
aether-lens-cli . --watch
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Monitoring the entire workspace**
> By specifying a target directory (e.g., `./sample`), you can also monitor only specific microservices or components.
