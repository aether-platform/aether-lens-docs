# Local DevLoop Acceleration

In modern development, the biggest bottleneck is the "lag between rewriting and verification." Aether Lens utilizes AI analysis and a fast feedback loop to shorten this cycle to the extreme.

## Execution Infrastructure on Aether Platform Native

As part of the Aether Platform, Aether Lens natively leverages a powerful cloud execution environment.

- **LensDaemon**: A service that manages the monitoring and execution lifecycle. It synchronizes with the platform to optimize resources.
- **Browserless Orchestrator**: Works with the sidecar environment on the platform to execute heavy rendering processes and multi-device verification in parallel on the cloud.
- **Smart Debouncing**: Provides smooth feedback to developers even with fast edits, while reducing the load on the platform side.

## Automated Pipeline

1. **Code Edit**: Developer saves a file.
2. **AI Vibe Check**: AI determines the "intent" and "risk" of changes in seconds.
3. **Execution**: Automatically runs a minimum set of tests (Visual / Command).
4. **Insight Feed**: Aggregates analysis results and execution status into the CLI summary panel.

### 🕒 A Day in the Life with Vibe Coding

Let's simulate a typical day of development with Aether Lens.

- **09:00**: Tweak button design. Lens instantly generates `Mobile` and `Tablet` screenshots. Detects "Padding issue" notification.
- **10:30**: Refactor complex authentication logic. Lens applies `Backend Strategy` in the background, automatically selecting and running relevant test cases.
- **14:00**: Create a pull request for a new feature. Lens shares verification results with the PR Agent via `A2A Context`.

## Troubleshooting

| Incident | Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Slow tests** | Too many browser instances running | Switch `browser_strategy` to `docker` or `kubernetes`. |
| **Diff not detected** | Included in `.gitignore` | Check the `excludes` in `aether-lens.config.json`. |
| **Inappropriate AI response** | Lack of context | Set `strategy` to `custom` and add `custom_instruction`. |

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Using `uv` allows for fast and clean dependency resolution.

```bash
uv pip install -e . --system
```

### 2. Initial Setup

Select a strategy that suits your project interactively.

```bash
aether-lens-cli init
```

### 3. Start LIVE Monitoring

As soon as you start `watch` mode, the Local DevLoop begins.

```bash
aether-lens-cli . --watch
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Monitoring the entire workspace**
> By specifying a target directory (e.g., `./sample`), you can also monitor only specific microservices or components.
